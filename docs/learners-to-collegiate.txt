* collegiate's HW has inf, sup and it elements

  inf: text | it | rom
  it: text | sup | inf
  sup: text | it | rom
  rom: text

  it, rom and sup appear to be italics, roman and supertext which are all
  markup. I'll just flatten the tree I suppose.

  sense markers appear in <sup> instead of [n].

* only one illustration per headword, only one audiofile per pron
